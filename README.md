# **C++ Module 08**

This repository contains solutions to various C++ programming challenges from the 42 School curriculum. Each module is designed to deepen students' understanding of different programming concepts and techniques.

## **Modules**

### **ex00 - Easy find**
A function template to find an element in a container.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a function template to search for an element.
- Demonstrating the use of standard library containers and algorithms.
- Ensuring proper handling of search results.

### **ex01 - Span**
A class that can store a range of numbers and provide methods to find the shortest and longest spans between them.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a `Span` class to store numbers.
- Providing methods to find the shortest and longest spans.
- Demonstrating an understanding of algorithms and container manipulation.

### **ex02 - Mutated abomination**
A class that uses various standard library algorithms to perform complex operations on a container.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a class that performs complex operations using standard library algorithms.
- Demonstrating the use of multiple algorithms in a single class.
- Ensuring proper resource management and algorithm efficiency.
